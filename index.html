<h2>Reproduction and Offspring</h2>

<p>
"Mating season for spiny bush vipers occurs during the rainy season between the end of summer and October.
 They reach sexual maturity between 2 and 3 years of age. Females are ovoviviparous, meaning they give birth to live young.
 After mating, females carry their fertilized eggs in their bodies for 6 to 7 months before giving birth to 9 to 12 young at a time in March or April.
 These young are about 6 inches in total length and are dark green with wavy stripes. They attain their adult coloration after 3 to 4 months.
 Due to their remote location from humans,
 scientists do not know their life span in the wild,
 but these creatures can live more than 12 years in captivity."

 <h2>Diet and Behavior</h2>
 
 
 
 
 <p>
These snakes eat small mammals, birds, lizards, and frogs. They hunt mostly in trees but can hunt for mammal prey on the ground.
 They ambush their prey by hanging from trees or hiding in foliage and curling up into an S-shape before lunging at prey, killing them with their venom.
 Spiny bush vipers are nocturnal creatures, spending the daytime basking on top of flowers in small trees about 10 feet off the ground.
